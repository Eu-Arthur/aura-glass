# Assert that every stylesheet in css/ is installed, applied and previewed, and
# that the cascade runs in the order the numeric prefixes ask for.
#
# This exists because three separate places decide the fate of a sheet and only
# one of them is a glob:
#
#   lib/steps*.sh     install_css copies css/shell-NN-*.css and css/gtk4-NN-*.css
#                     by glob, plus four sheets named explicitly
#   tools/preview.sh  build_profile copies the same set into the preview profile
#   bin/aura-glass-apply
#                     concatenates SHELL_SNIPPETS and GTK4_SNIPPETS, which are
#                     hand-written arrays naming every file
#
# So adding css/shell-25-whatever.css gets it installed into $CONF_DIR by the
# glob and rendered in a preview, and then silently never applied, because the
# array in aura-glass-apply was not updated. Nothing errors. The sheet is on
# disk, in the right place, with the right contents, and does nothing — which is
# the same "half-applied look with no error to explain it" this project pins its
# upstreams to avoid.
#
# The arrays cannot simply be replaced by a sorted glob: shell-popup-blur.css
# has to land after shell-90-density.css, and '9' sorts before 'p'. So the order
# stays hand-written and this checks it instead.
#
# Run it after adding, removing or renaming a sheet. Exits non-zero naming the
# file and the list that disagrees.
