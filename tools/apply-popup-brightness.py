"""Set how bright the popup blur comes out.

    apply-popup-brightness.py PERCENT

Blur My Shell keeps a blur's brightness in two places — the per-component key
the older releases read, and a `brightness` param inside the `pipelines` blob
the current ones read. lib/steps-dconf.sh writes the first one; this writes the
second, which needs more than a dconf write because the blob holds every
pipeline at once and only one of them is the popups'.

Which one that is comes from the popup component's own `pipeline` key rather
than from a hard-coded id, so repointing the component in dconf/core.ini moves
this with it instead of quietly turning it into a no-op.

Text rewriting rather than GVariant parsing, for the same reason
apply_blur_strength does it that way: the blob round-trips through `dconf
read`/`dconf write` as the text dconf itself prints, and a regex over one
pipeline's slice of it cannot invent keys that were not already there.
