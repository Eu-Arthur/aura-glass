"""Rewrite the installed stylesheets to a different set of corner radii.

    apply-radius-preset.py CONF_DIR WINDOW MENU QUICK_SETTINGS \\
                           NOTIFICATION DIALOG POPUP OSD BUTTON

The eight values are positional, in tools/token_manifest.py's RADIUS_TOKENS
order — the same order tokens/tokens.sh's radius_preset_values() sets them in.
OSD is accepted and ignored here: no stylesheet paints it, Custom OSD draws the
pill and Blur My Shell rounds the blur, so it is applied as a dconf key by
apply_radius_dconf() in lib/steps-dconf.sh. BUTTON is the opposite case — it
has a stylesheet site and no dconf key, buttons being nothing Blur My Shell
rounds — so it is rewritten here and skipped there. Both stay in the argument
list so that one preset is one argument vector everywhere rather than two
shapes that have to be kept in step.

CONF_DIR is ~/.config/aura-glass — the flat copies install_css puts there, never
the repo. css/ and dconf/core.ini stay at the shipped `default` values so
tools/check-tokens.sh keeps checking one known state; this rewrites what is
actually loaded. bin/aura-glass-apply then splices the result into the theme,
exactly as it does after install_transparency_css rescales the alphas.

Which sites get rewritten is tools/token_manifest.py's answer, not this file's:
every capture group of every radius entry's regex is a number to replace. That
is the same list tools/check-tokens.sh asserts against, so a site this misses is
a site the checker was not watching either — and tools/check-radius-preset.sh
fails if either of those is true.
