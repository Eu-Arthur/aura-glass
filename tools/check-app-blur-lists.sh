# Assert the per-app blur lists survive the trip from a flag, through a memo, to
# a dconf array literal — and back out again as the same patterns.
#
# The lists are the one place in this project where arbitrary user text reaches
# dconf. A pattern is whatever someone typed into the settings window, and it is
# spliced into a GVariant literal to get there, so the failure mode is not a
# wrong look but a `dconf write` that will not parse — or worse, one that parses
# as something else. install.sh has `set -e`, so that ends the run part-way
# through with a message about GVariant that says nothing about which app name
# caused it.
#
# Nothing here touches live dconf. The literal is built and then parsed back with
# GLib's own parser, which is the same code dconf would use.
