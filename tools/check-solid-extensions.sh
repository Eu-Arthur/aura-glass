# can only ever prove the wording. This script calls the functions directly
# instead, with DRY_RUN=0, against a stub gnome-extensions and a scratch
# $HOME, so the actual file on disk is what gets checked. It never runs
# install.sh itself and never touches the developer's real GNOME session:
# gsettings and dconf talk to the live session bus no matter what $HOME says,
# so a real (non-dry) install.sh run is never safe here — only the two
# extension functions, with gnome-extensions itself stubbed out, are.
