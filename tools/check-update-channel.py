"""Assert the settings window and the update check agree on which line a checkout is on.

There are two lines — releases on main, and commits on a branch someone is
testing — and two programs decide which one a checkout is on: the window, in
current_branch/is_test_build/installed_version, and bin/aura-glass-update-check,
in the case statement it opens with. Neither can read the other, so nothing stops
them drifting apart, and the ways they would drift are all quiet:

  the window naming a test build after a release tag it merely inherited, so a
      tester reads "v0.1.7" and believes they are running the release;

  the check following tags on a branch, so a tester is offered a release that
      does not contain the thing they are testing;

  the window refusing to install on a branch, which is the whole feature.

So this builds throwaway git repositories, asks both programs what they think is
installed, and holds them to the same answer. Nothing here touches the network,
the user's checkout or the user's $CONF_DIR: origin is a second local repository
and $AURA_GLASS_CONF points at a temporary directory.
