"""Assert the settings window's radius numbers agree with tokens/tokens.sh.

The window carries its own copy of the seven preset rows and of the per-surface
bounds, because it has to know them before install.sh runs — the spin rows need
their ranges at build time, and the preset buttons have to set eight values
without shelling out on every click.

That is the same arrangement tokens.sh already defends for the stylesheets: the
values live literally where they are used, and a checker makes the duplication
checked rather than trusted. This is that checker for the window's copy. Change
radius_preset_values() or radius_bounds() and run this, and it names every
number the window still disagrees about.

Run from anywhere; needs bash and python3, no display and no network.
