"""Assert the setup wizard builds install.sh arguments install.sh accepts.

gui/aura_glass_setup_wizard.py is a front end for install.sh's flags: it asks
the opening questions in a window, prints a command line, and install.sh parses
it with the same code that parses a hand-typed one. Everything downstream is
therefore only as correct as that command line, and a wizard that composes a
list install.sh rejects has turned a working install into an error message
before a single file was written.

So this checks four things:

  composition — the exact argument list for a set of answers. Reading these
      cases is the fastest way to see what pressing Install will do.

  acceptance — every one of those lists is then fed to install.sh
      --settings-only --dry-run, which parses and resolves it against the real
      rules and changes nothing.

  wiring — the page list, the per-page Skip fields and the page builders are
      three hand-written tables that name each other by string. A typo in any
      of them is a Skip button that silently does nothing, or a Next that
      raises. Nothing else would catch that until someone clicked it.

  links — the icon and pointer pack URLs, against lib/steps.sh's clone pins.
      The window offers to open somebody else's project; it should be the one
      the installer is about to clone.

Run it after changing Answers.to_argv, after changing the pages, and after
changing any flag in install.sh that the wizard sends.
