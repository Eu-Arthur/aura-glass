# Assert aura-glass-update-check compares versions the way versions compare.
#
# The whole feature is one question — is the remote tag newer than the local one
# — and the ways to get it wrong are quiet. A lexicographic compare puts v0.1.10
# before v0.1.9, so the release after the ninth would never be announced. A
# too-loose tag filter lets a `nightly` or a `v2-old-backup` rank above every
# real release and announces an update that does not exist. Neither shows up as
# an error; both just make the notification wrong forever.
#
# So this builds throwaway git repositories with known tags and runs the real
# script against them. Nothing here touches the network, the user's checkout, or
# the user's $CONF_DIR: origin is a second local repository, and $AURA_GLASS_CONF
# points at a temporary directory.
