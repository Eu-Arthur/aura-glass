"""Assert the settings window builds install.sh arguments install.sh accepts.

gui/aura_glass_settings.py sends only the flags that changed, which keeps it out
of the business of resolving precedence — but it puts it squarely in the business
of not emitting a combination install.sh refuses. There is at least one: passing
--no-blur alongside --window-blur is a hard error by design, because whichever
way it were silently resolved would be the opposite of what half the people
writing it meant.

So this checks two different things:

  composition — the exact argument list for a set of transitions, including the
      ones where a flag has to be restated because another flag moved it. Reading
      these cases is the fastest way to see what Apply will do.

  acceptance — every one of those lists is then fed to install.sh --settings-only
      --dry-run, which parses and resolves it against the real precedence rules
      and changes nothing. A list that composes as expected but dies in the
      parser is still broken, and only the second half can tell.

Run it after changing flags_against, and after changing any flag in install.sh
that the window sends.
