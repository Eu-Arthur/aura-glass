# Assert that --glass-mode resolves into the blur flags the design table says.
#
# Everything runs through install.sh --settings-only --dry-run, which parses and
# resolves exactly as a real run would and writes nothing. The mode is a
# resolution rule, so resolution is what this checks: which WANT_* the mode
# leaves behind, which explicit flag beats it, and which combination is refused.
#
# Runs under a scratch $HOME rather than the developer's own. --settings-only
# fills in whatever a flag did not say from $CONF_DIR memos, so running against
# a real ~/.config/aura-glass would make the expected answers depend on that
# machine's history — a glass-mode memo of "solid" left over from a previous run
# would break the bare --no-blur case below, which expects the default
# frosted-shaped answer rather than whatever this machine last remembered.

# Back to frosted: its own answers come back, not the shared memos just

# downstream reader gated on their own *_EXPLICIT flag rather than on
# emptiness (apply_popup_blur and apply_app_blur in lib/steps-dconf.sh, plus
# install.sh's own block for scope), and that reader runs after the
# glass-mode line is printed and only ever touches its own local copy of the
# value — so the line itself prints the same popup=0 whether or not the
# re-read after it was skipped. What actually moves is the dconf write those
# functions make, echoed here because this is a dry run. blur-strength and
# shell-tint-color have no such second reader — apply_blur_strength and
# apply_shell_tint_color only fall back to the shared memo when the value
# itself is still empty, which load_glass_mode_memos never leaves it — so
# their own dry-run lines are asserted on for the same reason: it is where
# this run says what it actually resolved to.
