# Render this working tree's theme in a throwaway GNOME session and screenshot
# it, without touching the desktop you are sitting in front of.
#
# Why this exists: every CSS and dconf value here used to be checked by editing
# a file, applying it, logging out, and looking. That loop is slow enough that
# wrong values survived for weeks — see the corner-radius bisections in
# handoff.md. This runs the real shell against the real theme and hands back
# PNGs in about a minute.
#
#   tools/preview.sh                 shell screenshots from the current tree
#   tools/preview.sh --gtk-only      one GTK app, no shell, on your own session
#   tools/preview.sh --keep          leave the session up (see --keep below)
#   tools/preview.sh --gpu           sample GPU busy% while the session runs
#   tools/preview.sh --solid         render --no-blur mode instead of the glass one
#   tools/preview.sh --transparency 0.85   translucent app windows at that level
#   tools/preview.sh --tint 70             how much theme colour survives, vs black
#   tools/preview.sh --style adwaita       titlebar buttons in an alternate style
#
# Every run is compared against the last accepted run of the same mode, and
# reports what moved. tools/check-shots.py --accept adopts the current run as
# the baseline; --mode glass and --mode solid keep separate ones.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this is NOT
#
# This is a headless render, not a window you can click around in. mutter 18 on
# this machine has no nested backend compiled in — `MetaBackendX11Nested` is not
# in libmutter-18.so, and gnome-shell's `--nested` option is gone — so a shell
# started inside your session takes the *native* backend, tries to take control
# of the seat, and dies with EBUSY against the session you are using. `gnome-
# shell --headless --virtual-monitor` is the mode that works, and it renders to
# a virtual output that only the screenshot API can see.
#
# Isolation is three separate things, and all three are needed:
#
#   dbus-run-session   a private bus, so the preview shell owns org.gnome.Shell
#                      without fighting the real one, and so the driver
#                      extension is reachable by nothing outside this session.
#   HOME               the User Themes extension reads ~/.themes/<name> relative
#                      to $HOME, which no XDG variable governs.
#   XDG_{CONFIG,DATA,CACHE}_HOME   where the preview session's own state lands,
#                      including the GSettings keyfile it is seeded from.
#                      Settings deliberately do not go through dconf here — see
#                      the long note in tools/preview-session.sh.
#
#   XDG_RUNTIME_DIR    isolated too, and this one is not optional. GNOME Shell
#                      disables every extension when
#                      $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gnome-shell-disable-extensions exists,
#                      and the live session leaves that file lying in the real
#                      one — so sharing it renders a stock desktop with no blur
#                      and no top bar geometry, which looks exactly like the
#                      theme having failed. Nothing is lost by isolating it: a
#                      headless shell has no host compositor to reach, and the
#                      test apps are launched with the same isolated value, so
#                      they still find the preview socket.
