"""Where every token in tokens/tokens.sh is written down.

This is the pairing list tokens.sh's per-token comments describe, in the form a
program can use. It exists as a module rather than inline in one script because
two tools need the same list and a second copy would be a second thing to
forget:

    tools/check-tokens.sh        reads it to assert the repo still agrees
    tools/apply-radius-preset.py reads it to rewrite an *installed* copy

The checker is why the list is trustworthy; the writer is why it has to be
complete. A radius site missing from here is not merely unchecked — it is a
corner that keeps the shipped value while every corner around it moves, which
is the exact "two stacked surfaces" fault tokens.sh was written to prevent.

Each entry is (token name, kind, *args).

  css: (file, regex) — every capture group of every match must equal the token.
       The regex MUST match at least once; a regex that has stopped matching
       because a selector was renamed is a silently-passing check, which is
       worse than no check, so that is a failure too.

       For the writer, each capture group's span is the text it substitutes, so
       a group must wrap the number and nothing else.

  ini: (file, section, key) — the key's value in that section must equal the
       token. Section-scoped because corner-radius and sigma both appear under
       several Blur My Shell components with different values.

  raw: (file, regex) — checked exactly like css, and deliberately not returned
       by css_entries(). It is for a value buried inside one dconf key rather
       than standing on its own as a key of its own: Blur My Shell keeps every
       pipeline in a single GVariant blob under `pipelines`, and a corner effect
       inside it is a radius the section/key form cannot reach. The writer for
       these is apply_radius_dconf, which reads the live key rather than a file
       in $CONF_DIR — which is why apply-radius-preset.py must not see them.

The `[^}]*?` in the CSS patterns cannot cross a closing brace, so each one stays
inside the rule its selector opened.
