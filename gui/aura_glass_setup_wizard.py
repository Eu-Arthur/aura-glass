"""aura-glass — the opening questions, asked in a window.

install.sh runs this before it installs anything, walks the answers back into
its own flag parser, and carries on in the terminal. That is the whole of the
contract: this window does not install, configure, or write anything. It
composes a command line and prints it.

  stdout  the flags install.sh should run with, one token per line. Nothing
          else may ever be printed there — lib/steps-wizard.sh reads it.
  stderr  anything worth saying to a human.
  exit 0  answered.
  exit 2  cancelled, and install.sh stops. Closing the window is cancelling.
  else    something went wrong; install.sh asks the same questions in the
          terminal instead, so a traceback here costs a nicer wizard rather
          than the install.

  ┌─ PARITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Every question here has a twin in install.sh's text wizard (search for     │
  │ "Step 1: Choose Accent Color"), which is what runs where there is no       │
  │ display, no PyGObject, or no wish to install one. Adding a question to     │
  │ one and not the other is a setting that half the users on half the         │
  │ machines are never offered. Add it to both.                                │
  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Two deliberate differences from gui/aura_glass_settings.py, which is the other
window in this project:

  It runs before there is an install. The settings window refuses to open
  without $CONF_DIR and reconstructs the checkout path from a memo; this is
  handed --repo by the script that launched it, out of the checkout it is
  sitting in.

  install.sh blocks on it. The settings window spawns terminals it never waits
  for, because nothing downstream depends on them. Here the exit code and the
  stdout are the entire point — do not make this asynchronous.

It also deliberately does not import pycairo or anything else beyond PyGObject:
what lib/distro.sh probes for is what this is allowed to need.
