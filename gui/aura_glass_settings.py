"""aura-glass settings — retune an installed aura-glass without the terminal.

    aura-glass-settings

Every control here is a flag install.sh already had. This window reads the
current answer out of ~/.config/aura-glass, shows it, and on Apply runs

    install.sh --settings-only --yes <only the flags that changed>

rather than writing any theme file itself. That division is deliberate: the
precedence between a flag, a $CONF_DIR memo and a default is intricate — see the
resolution block in install.sh and the apply_* functions in lib/steps-dconf.sh —
and a GUI with its own copy of it would drift from the installer within one
release. Passing only what changed means every untouched setting is resolved by
exactly the code that resolved it last time.

--settings-only is what makes that safe to drive from a window: it reapplies the
dconf preset, the CSS and the gsettings, and skips the theme, the extensions and
everything that wants root (the rounded-blur library, GDM). So Apply needs no
password and no terminal to answer a prompt in.

The icon pack, the pointer and the interface font are the exceptions, and only
when a row here has actually been changed: asking for a different one is asking
for it to be installed. Anything already on disk applies instantly — all three
steps skip when it is there — and anything that is not gets fetched, which is
why each of those rows says so. A flagless --settings-only still touches the
network not at all.

Accent is here, but as one of nine names install.sh understands rather than a
colour picker, because it is not this project's setting to own — the shell CSS
reads -st-accent-color and the GTK CSS reads @accent_bg_color, so
Settings -> Appearance already recolours the desktop live. The row exists to keep
the remembered value in step; the button beside it goes to the real thing.

Nor is a custom hex on offer, which looks like an omission and is not: -st-
accent-color is a read-only keyword backed by a nine-value C enum, so a hex
would reach every app window and none of the shell. tokens/tokens.sh has the
long version.

Not everything here rides on Apply. Three kinds of thing cannot:

  the extensions       instant, reversible and unprivileged, but not settings
                       install.sh resolves — so they apply as they are clicked,
                       through bin/aura-glass-ext
  the packages page    a filesystem delete for a pack under $HOME, with no flag
                       or memo behind it; and for one under /usr, a package
                       manager command handed to a terminal, because those
                       files are a package's and deleting them out from under
                       it would leave its database describing files that are
                       gone
  anything root        the dependency install, the rounded-blur library, the
                       login screen, the monitor sync, the uninstall scopes

The last of those used to be absent for a good reason: sudo down a pipe that
nothing can type into blocks forever. The answer is not to run it here but to
open a terminal that has a keyboard attached, which is what run_in_terminal
does — and to say so, rather than starting something that would silently
decline. Those rows report the last state this window read, not a live one:
a spawned terminal is deliberately not waited on, so there is nothing to wait
for.

One thing on the per-app page is not a setting anyone is asked for. This
window's own wm_class is pinned onto the blur allow list and taken off the
block list on every install.sh run, and shown here already pinned, because the
window that explains the glass cannot be the one window without it — unblurred
it argues for an effect while demonstrating its absence. apply_app_blur in
lib/steps-dconf.sh is the copy that reaches dconf; pin_self_allow below is the
copy that decides what the lists here say, so that they say what the next run
will install rather than what the memos hold. That is also why every popup this
window opens is a window: an Adw.Dialog is drawn inside its parent, and Blur My
Shell blurs behind toplevels, so a sheet had the settings page behind it rather
than the desktop — and a sheet is pinned to the middle of what it covers, which
the apply log and the confirmations have as much reason to be dragged off as
the tint picker does.

    a slider is the one that changes it, and it changes it silently. Its scroll

    bubble up to the GtkScrolledWindow the page sits in and scroll it, the way
    it does over a label.

    Values are whole numbers. Both bars stand for an integer setting, and
    round_digits is what stops a drag parking on 89.6, reporting 90 and
    installing neither.
