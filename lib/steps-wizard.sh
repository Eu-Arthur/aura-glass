# aura-glass — handing the opening questions to a window.
#
# The questions themselves are install.sh's, and so are the answers: everything
# downstream of the wizard reads flags, and this only decides which of two things
# collects them. gui/aura_glass_setup_wizard.py asks them in a window and prints
# the flags it settled on; install.sh's own text wizard asks the same ones here
# in the terminal. Both end at the same parse_flags call.
#
# That is the whole design. The window is a front end for the flag surface rather
# than a second configuration path, so there is nothing it can express that a
# command line cannot, and nothing to keep in sync but the questions.
#
# Anything that is not "the user answered" falls back to the text wizard rather
# than stopping: no display, no toolkit, a declined package install, a Python
# traceback on an unusual desktop. The one exception is Cancel, which is an
# answer — see run_setup_wizard's return codes.

# run_setup_wizard — fills WIZARD_ARGS with the flags the window settled on.
#
#   0  answered; WIZARD_ARGS holds the flags
#   1  cancelled; the caller stops the install
#   2  no window was available; the caller asks in the terminal instead
