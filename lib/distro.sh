# compiles its SCSS at install time.
#
# python3 is here because it is load-bearing rather than incidental: every
# extension's metadata is checked through it (ext_supports_shell), the display
# density is measured and the correction emitted through it, enabled-extensions
# is appended through it, and bin/aura-glass-apply does its whole block-replace
# in it. Without it the install used to pass this check, report "all"
# dependencies present", and then die part-way through with a bare "command not
# found" — which is the one failure mode this step exists to prevent. Arch
# spells the package `python`; Fedora and Debian spell it `python3`.
