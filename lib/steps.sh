# The steps themselves were one 1300-line file until they were split by concern,
# the same way css/ was. What lives where:
#
#   lib/steps.sh              the upstream pins, the paths, the extension lists,
#                             preflight, the theme itself, and the closing note
#   lib/steps-extensions.sh   every extension: the ones fetched from EGO, the
#                             three built from a pinned commit, and the
#                             rounded-blur library
#   lib/steps-assets.sh       icon and cursor themes
#   lib/steps-css.sh          the CSS tweaks and the display-density correction
#   lib/steps-dconf.sh        the dconf preset, and the gsettings beside it
#   lib/steps-integration.sh  the icon-sync agent, the Flatpak override and the
#                             panel blur unit
#
# install.sh sources all six. They are definitions only — nothing runs at source
# time — so the order between them does not matter, except that this file has to
# come first: it defines CONF_DIR, which install.sh reads while parsing flags.

# Upstreams are pinned. Both move regularly, and a theme that changes under the
# CSS tweaks is exactly how you get a half-applied look with no error message.
