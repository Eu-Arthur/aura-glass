# GNOME ships Cantarell and nothing here argues with that being a reasonable
# default, which is why --font system is the default and resets rather than
# writes. The other three are the fonts this look was drawn against, and none
# of them is packaged widely enough to assume: picking one that is not on the
# machine would set a gsettings key to a family fontconfig cannot resolve, and
# the desktop would silently render in the fallback instead. So the step that
# offers them is also the step that installs them.
#
# Everything lands under one directory, $FONT_DIR, and nothing outside it is
# touched — the packaged copy of a font that is already installed system-wide
# keeps working, and uninstall.sh removes this directory whole.
#
# The families each value resolves to are not guessable from the value, which
# is why font_family exists rather than a title-cased FONT:
#
#   misans   MiSans Latin      (the Latin zip's family; the full MiSans is CJK)
#   inter    Inter             (Inter.ttc; InterVariable is a separate family)
#   sf-pro   SF Pro Display    (the Text faces install too, for anything that
#                               asks for them — dconf/core.ini's panel font does)
#
# Sourced by install.sh.
