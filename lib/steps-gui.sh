# gui/aura_glass_settings.py is a front end for install.sh --settings-only and
# nothing more: it reads the $CONF_DIR memos, shows them, and shells out with the
# flags that changed. So installing it is three copies and a desktop entry, with
# no schema to compile and no service to register.
#
# It is optional in the way --icons is optional. PyGObject and libadwaita are not
# dependencies of a GTK theme, and a machine without them still gets every
# setting the window exposes, as flags.
#
# Sourced by install.sh.
