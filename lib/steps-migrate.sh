# Moving a pre-rename install onto the current names.
#
# The project was called tahoe-glass, and before that tahoe-tweaks. The rename
# to aura-glass replaced the strings but moved nothing, so an install made
# before it still keeps its settings in ~/.config/tahoe-glass while every
# current binary writes to ~/.config/aura-glass. That split is the thing this
# file closes, and it has to close it before anything reads either path.
#
# Separately: the GTK theme itself is upstream's, and upstream's installer
# hardcodes ~/.themes/Tahoe-Dark with no flag to change it. So the theme is
# renamed after that installer runs rather than instead of it.
#
# Sourced by install.sh, which calls migrate_legacy_names once, immediately
# after parse_flags and before the first $CONF_DIR read.
