# aura-glass — the CSS tweaks, and the display-density correction.

# install_css copies whatever css/ holds into $CONF_DIR and then runs
# bin/aura-glass-apply, which concatenates the sheets in cascade order into one
# marked block. The numeric prefix on a sheet is its cascade position, not
# decoration; tools/check-cascade.sh asserts the two agree.
#
# The density block is generated here rather than kept in css/, because it is
# written for whatever screen the installer is actually run on.

# The CSS is written in logical pixels and was tuned on a 3440x1440 34" display
# — 109 logical PPI. GNOME's stylesheet has no media queries, so those numbers
# are the same on every screen and a dense panel renders them proportionally
# smaller: at the 144 PPI of a 15" 1080p laptop the top bar status icons come
# out a third under the size they were drawn for. Measure the panel at install
