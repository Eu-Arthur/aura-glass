# Three of them cannot come from extensions.gnome.org as they are. Blur My Shell
# is built from a pinned commit because no release carries the popup component,
# plus a patch of this project's own; Open Bar and Custom OSD are built from
# their last upstream commit plus a patch in patches/, because neither has a
# GNOME 50 release. gnome-rounded-blur is not
# an extension at all but the C library that lets the popup blur be dynamic, and
# it is the only thing this project installs outside $HOME.
#
# Sourced by install.sh. See lib/steps.sh for the pins these use.

# EGO's shell_version filter is loose — it will happily hand you a build whose
# metadata stops at 49 when you ask for 50 — so the download is always checked
# against the running shell rather than trusted.
