# aura-glass — the three glass modes.
#
# A mode is not a fourth kind of setting — it is a name for a combination of the
# blur, transparency and styling flags install.sh already has, plus a drawer to
# keep each combination's own tuning in. Everything here therefore resolves into
# those flags and then gets out of the way: nothing downstream of this file
# knows a mode exists.
#
# Precedence, highest first: a flag the user typed, then --glass-mode, then the
# remembered mode, then a mode derived from the state the flags leave behind.
# The rule is the ordinary one — an explicit answer beats an inferred one — and
# it is why apply_glass_mode tests every *_EXPLICIT before it moves anything.
# Frosted and transparent apply that by leaving an explicit sub-flag's answer
# alone; solid has no tuning left to concede once the theme has stood down, so
# it applies the same rule by refusing the run instead of silently overruling
# one.

# The mode the resolved state amounts to, which is what gets remembered. Solid
# is the styling being down rather than the blur being off: --no-blur on its own
# is an opaque theme, not a theme that has stood down, and remembering it as
# solid would stand the styling down on the next flagless run.
