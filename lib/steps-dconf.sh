# over, by corner-radius above and by the effect here. Only the first moved with
# a preset, which left a `soft` desktop rounding one at 16 and the other at 30:
# the two-stacked-surfaces fault tokens/tokens.sh exists to prevent, inside a

# and the value moved here cannot drift apart. It matches by pipeline name: the
# id beside it is generated per machine and is not a thing to hard-code.

# round surfaces that are not among the eight a preset covers, and
# `default rounded` is named by no component at all.

# The popup keys themselves ship in dconf/core.ini so the whole preset stays

#
# The on/off choice, because dconf load rewrites the section on every run — a
# flagless re-install would quietly turn popup blur back on over a deliberate
# --no-popup-blur. Same reason --grain and --icons are remembered.
#
# static-blur, because the right value depends on the machine. Rounded corners
# on a dynamic blur need the gnome-rounded-blur library; a static blur rounds
# itself. So when the library is missing this falls back to static, and the
# corners stay round instead of going square. It self-heals: install the
# library, re-run, and it flips back to dynamic.
# Which windows the applications component treats, as wm_class patterns.
#
# Blur My Shell compiles these and matches a window's wm_class against them
# (components/applications.js, matchesAnyPattern), so `*chrome*` covers every
# spelling Chrome uses. Which list is consulted depends on enable-all: with it
# off only the allow list is blurred, with it on everything except the block
# list is. That is the same choice --app-blur-scope makes, which is why gtk mode
# reads one list and all mode reads the other.
#
# The same test decides the actor opacity in apply_app_opacity — Blur My Shell
# applies both to whatever passes it — so these lists govern which windows go
# translucent as much as which ones get a blur. There is no way to separate the
# two, and no per-app control over the stylesheet's own alpha at all: GTK CSS
# has no selector for "this application".
#
# Shipped as defaults rather than written into dconf/core.ini, because a user's
# edited list has to survive the next install and dconf load rewrites whole
# sections. $CONF_DIR/app-blur-allow and app-blur-block hold the edited copies,
# one pattern per line, and are what the settings window writes.

# rung at a time — they are already in proportion to each other, chosen against
# what each surface sits in front of, and what people actually want is the
# whole set softer or crisper. Scaling keeps those proportions: the panel stays
# heavier than the dock at every setting.
#
# Both places a blur radius lives are scaled, because Blur My Shell has two.
# The per-component `sigma` keys are what the older releases read. The
# `pipelines` blob is what the current ones read, and it carries the same
# number again as `unscaled_radius` inside each effect. A run that moved one
# and not the other would soften the desktop on one machine and do nothing on
# the next.
#
# Sigmas are written from the tokens rather than read back and multiplied, so
# the value cannot compound over repeated installs. The blob has to be read —
# there is no token for its seven copies — but dconf load has just rewritten it
# from dconf/core.ini a few lines above, which is the same assumption apply_grain
# already makes.
